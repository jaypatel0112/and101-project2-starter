# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: **Jay Patel**

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Debugging Application** is an android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!  It shows the variety of things like addition, for loop, current day, favourite number, and random colors.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: 1. 😎 2. 🎧 3. 👌
